# async-api-load-tester
High-performance asynchronous API load testing tool built with asyncio, aiohttp, and detailed analytics for real-world benchmarking.


`Async API Load Tester is a professional-grade benchmarking tool designed for developers who need to evaluate API performance under realistic traffic conditions. Built using Python’s asyncio framework and aiohttp, the project simulates thousands of concurrent users while collecting detailed latency, throughput, and failure metrics. It supports configurable test scenarios, dynamic request payloads, and exportable reports for performance analysis. This repository demonstrates advanced asynchronous programming patterns, structured logging, and scalable system testing techniques used in modern backend engineering environments.`
